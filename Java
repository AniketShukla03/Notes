Class Variables (Static Fields)
Local Variables
Parameters
local variable -A variable declared inside the body of the method is called local variable. A local variable cannot be defined with "static" keyword.
instance variable - A variable declared inside the class but outside the body of the method, is called an instance variable. It is not declared as static.
static variable - A variable that is declared as static is called a static variable. It cannot be local. You can create a single copy of the static variable and share it among all the instances of the class.
- Are used to store data
